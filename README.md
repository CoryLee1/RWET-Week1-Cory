###Inspiration：We learn the basic straightforward string manipulation techniques of Python.I think it's like give us a scissors
and glue to tear the material apart and randomise them to create something new.So I am thinking about what kind of things from my life or from nature have similar traits of randomness and order.Then I happened to see Yoshinori MIZUTANI's photography(Link:
https://www.shashasha.co/en/book/hanon)He captured The spectacle of hundreds of birds lined up on overhead wires against the Tokyo sky.I found these scenes are super interesting.as if the black birds themselves were music notes or the words lining up on the sky.So it became my visual inspiration.--"What if we see the birds perched on a wire it's words"(Format Inspiration)

Then I started to think about the content, what would "the birds on a wire" mean to the audience, to the nature or to myself? As Yoshinori様 said "The sight of large flocks of cormorants in a city was incongruous and out of place. It appeared to be a kind of grim warning to modern society."At the same time, the birds would also be a "witness" to the city.I want to simulate birds' perspective to transcript people's daily activities.Whether it's the birds perched on power lines or the daily lives of people within a neighborhood, both are part of the city and community's landscape.________--\(˙<>˙)/--________

###Dataset reference:
Urban Legend?(But I didn't find any usable dataset)
Chen, Yi-Pei & Yen, An-Zi & Huang, Hen-Hsen & Nakayama, Hideki & Chen, Hsin-Hsi. (2023). LED: A Dataset for Life Event Extraction from Dialogs. https://github.com/ntunlplab/LifeEventDialog/tree/main 

###How to write the whole poem in code:
1.Draw 5 lines of electronic wires
2.set fixed sentences
3.set pattern of people's activities
4.combine all of them together
