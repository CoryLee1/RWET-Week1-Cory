# ###Inspiration：

We learn the basic straightforward string manipulation techniques of Python.I think it's like give us a scissors
and glue to tear the material apart and randomise them to create something [new.So](http://new.so/) I am thinking about what kind of things from my life or from nature have similar traits of randomness and order.Then I happened to see Yoshinori MIZUTANI's photography(Link:
https://www.shashasha.co/en/book/hanon)He captured The spectacle of hundreds of birds lined up on overhead wires against the Tokyo sky.I found these scenes are super [interesting.as](http://interesting.as/) if the black birds themselves were music notes or the words lining up on the [sky.So](http://sky.so/) it became my visual inspiration.--"What if we see the birds perched on a wire it's words"(Format Inspiration)

Then I started to think about the content, what would "the birds on a wire" mean to the audience, to the nature or to myself? As Yoshinori様 said "The sight of large flocks of cormorants in a city was incongruous and out of place. It appeared to be a kind of grim warning to modern society."At the same time, the birds would also be a "witness" to the city.I want to simulate birds' perspective to transcript people's daily activities.Whether it's the birds perched on power lines or the daily lives of people within a neighborhood, both are part of the city and community's landscape.**--\(˙<>˙)/--**

# ###Dataset reference:

Urban Legend?(But I didn't find any usable dataset)
Chen, Yi-Pei & Yen, An-Zi & Huang, Hen-Hsen & Nakayama, Hideki & Chen, Hsin-Hsi. (2023). LED: A Dataset for Life Event Extraction from Dialogs. https://github.com/ntunlplab/LifeEventDialog/tree/main

# ###How to write the whole poem in code:

pre-setting：read and get data from jsonl file 
1.Draw 7 lines of electronic wires
2.set fixed sentences
3.set pattern of people's activities
4.combine all of them together

[The difference between json and jsonl](https://www.notion.so/The-difference-between-json-and-jsonl-a00384908bdd4147afc77abb8c44aecd?pvs=21)

# ###Limitation: Simply using dataset would not be enough

How to create Juxtaposition effect using the material I got

# ###Future Works:

### Content：

a. How to select words smartly to create dramatic and absurd effect

b. Anecdote dataset

c. How to make sure the poem is rhymed?

### Visualization：

Real time Animated text?(Currently have no clue to do it.)

### Gamifaction：

ARG(**alternate reality game, because the poems reveal some activities based on the location**) or text adventure game direction？like AI dungeon but you can only know the details of this world by poem

### Juxtaposition:

**Juxtaposition** is an act or instance, of placing two elements close together or side by side. This is often done in order to [compare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison)/contrast the two, to show similarities or differences, etc.

The texts also touch on how contemporary poetry often leaves gaps in sense, challenging readers to actively participate in the creation of meaning.

poets like Lewis Carroll and others use nonsense and ambiguity to engage readers and disrupt ordinary patterns of meaning.

illustrating how poetry can turn familiar words into complex concepts, much like Carroll's wordplay, which juxtaposes nonsensical elements with logical structure. This engagement with language and its intricacies is presented as a unique characteristic of poetic form.

syllogism in poetry, highlighting the difference between logical structures and the personal, historical logic that poems can embody

David Antin's poem "Stanzas" is an example where logical syllogistic forms are used to create a narrative,

how language poets utilize linguistic structures and the interplay of word meanings within the language system itself. The idea is that language and meaning are built through differences and relationships between words, much like how binary code represents complex data in computers.
