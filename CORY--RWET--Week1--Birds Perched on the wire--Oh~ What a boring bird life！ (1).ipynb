    "Then I started to think about the content, what would \"the birds on a wire\" mean to the audience, to the nature or to myself? As Yoshinori様 said \"The sight of large flocks of cormorants in a city was incongruous and out of place. It appeared to be a kind of grim warning to modern society.\"At the same time, the birds would also be a \"witness\" to the city.I want to simulate birds' perspective to transcript people's daily activities.Whether it's the birds perched on power lines or the daily lives of people within a neighborhood, both are part of the city and community's landscape.________--\\(˙<>˙)/--________\n",
