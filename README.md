###Inspiration：We learn the basic straightforward string manipulation techniques of Python.I think it's like give us a scissors  
and glue to tear the material apart and randomise them to create something new.So I am thinking about what kind of things from my   
life or from nature have similar traits of randomness and order.Then I happened to see Yoshinori MIZUTANI's photography(Link:  
https://www.shashasha.co/en/book/hanon)He captured The spectacle of hundreds of birds lined up on overhead wires against the Tokyo sky.  
I found these scenes are super interesting.as if the black birds themselves were music notes or the words lining up on the sky.  
So it became my visual inspiration.--"What if we see the birds perched on a wire it's words"(Format Inspiration)  
  
Then I started to think about the content, what would "the birds on a wire" mean to the audience, to the nature or to myself?   
As Yoshinori様 said "The sight of large flocks of cormorants in a city was incongruous and out of place. It appeared to be a kind of  
grim warning to modern society."At the same time, the birds would also be a "witness" to the city.I want to simulate birds' perspective  
to transcript people's daily activities.Whether it's the birds perched on power lines or the daily lives of people within a neighborhood,  
both are part of the city and community's landscape.________--\(˙<>˙)/--________

###How to write the whole poem in code:  
1.Draw 5 lines of electronic wires  
2.set fixed sentences  
3.set pattern of people's activities  
4.combine all of them together
